# Sandia Medical Devices Case Study

Medical Monitoring technology has advanced significantly in the last decade. Monitoring that once required a visit to a health-care facility can now be performed by devices located in a patient’s home or carried or worn at all times. Examples include measures of glucose level (blood sugar), pulse, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Measurements can be transmitted via telephone, Internet connection, and wireless data transmission standards, such as Bluetooth. A particularly powerful technology combination is a wearable device that records data periodically or continuously and transmits it via Bluetooth to a cell phone app. The cellphone app can inform the patient of problems and automatically transmit data and alerts to a central monitoring application (See Figure 1).

Health-care providers and patients incur significant costs when glucose levels are not maintained within acceptable tolerances. Short-term episodes of very high or very low glucose often result in an expensive visit to urgent care clinics or hospitals. In addition, patients with frequent but less severe episodes of high or low glucose are more susceptible to such expensive, long term complications as vision, circulatory, and kidney problems.

Sandi Medical Devices (SMD), an Albuquerque manufacturer of portable and wearable medical monitoring devices, has developed a glucose monitor embedded in the wristband. The device is powered by body heat and senses glucose levels from minute quantities of perspiration. SMD is developing the Real-Time Glucose Monitoring (RTGM) device in partnership with New Mexico Health System (NMHS), a comprehensive health delivery service with patients throughout New Mexico.

SMD will develop the initial prototype software for smartphones with Bluetooth capability running the Google Android operating system. If successful, NMHS and its patient will have free use of the software, and SMD will resell the software to other health systems worldwide.

As the project began, interviews with patients and physicians about potential RTGM capabilities and interaction modes identified several areas of concern that will need to be incorporated into the systems requirements and design. The relevant patient concerns include:

**- Viewing and interpreting data and trends.**

Patients would want to view more than their current glucose level. They would like to see glucose levels over various time periods, with a specific focus on time periods during which their glucose was within outside of acceptable ranges. A graphical view of the data is preferred, although some patients also want to be able to see actual numbers.

**- Entering additional data**

Some patients want to be able to enter text notes or voice messages to supplement glucose level data. For example, patients who see a high glucose alert might record voice messages describing how they feel or what they had recently eaten. Some patients thought that sharing such information with their health-care providers might be valuable, but others only wanted such information for themselves.

**Physicians expressed these concerns:**

- They do not want to be the “first line of response” to all alerts. They prefer that nurses or physician assistants be charged with that role and that physicians be notified only when frontline personnel determine that an emergency situation exists.
- They want to be able to monitor and view past patient data and trends in much the same way as described for patients.
- They want all their actions to be logged and patient-specific responses to be stored as part of the patient’s electronic medical record.


### Perform the following tasks by using the following information:

1.	Identify all the actors who will use RTGM.
2.	Using the actors you identified in question 1, develop a list of use cases based on the user goal technique. Draw a use case diagram for these use cases.
3.	Using the event decomposition technique for each event, you identified in the description, name the event, state the type of event, and name the resulting use case. Draw a use case diagram for these use cases.

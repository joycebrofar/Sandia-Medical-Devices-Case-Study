Let’s break down each part related to the Real-Time Glucose Monitoring (RTGM) device and its ecosystem.

# 1. Identify All the Actors Who Will Use RTGM
The primary actors for the RTGM system can include:

- Patients: Individuals who wear the RTGM device to monitor their glucose levels.
- Healthcare Providers: Doctors, nurses, and other medical staff who monitor patient data and respond to alerts.
- Family Members/Caregivers: Individuals who may assist patients in managing their health.
- SMD Developers/Technicians: Engineers and software developers involved in developing and maintaining the RTGM system.
- Health System Administrators: Individuals responsible for managing the healthcare system utilizing the RTGM data.


# 2. Develop a List of Use Cases Based on the User Goal Technique
Here are some potential use cases for the identified actors:

**Use Cases:**
- Monitor Glucose Levels (Patient)
- Receive Alerts for Glucose Levels (Patient, Healthcare Provider)
- Review Historical Data (Patient, Healthcare Provider)
- Send Data to Central Monitoring Application (Patient)
- Manage Device Settings (Patient)
- Respond to Alerts (Healthcare Provider)
- Access Patient Data (Healthcare Provider, Family Member/Caregiver)
- Update Software (SMD Developer/Technician)
- Generate Health Reports (Healthcare Provider, Health System Administrator)


# 3. Event Decomposition Technique for Each Event
Here’s a breakdown of a few events, their types, and the resulting use cases:

| Event Name | Type of Event | Resulting Use Case |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Glucose Level Changes Detected |	External Event |	Receive Alerts for Glucose Levels |
| Patient Requests Historical Data |	External Event |	Review Historical Data |
| Data Needs to be Sent |	Temporal Event |	Send Data to Central Monitoring Application |
| Alert Triggered |	External Event |	Respond to Alerts |
| Device Settings Updated |	Internal Event |	Manage Device Settings |
| Software Update Required |	Temporal Event |	Update Software |
| Health Report Needed |	Temporal Event |	Generate Health Reports |
